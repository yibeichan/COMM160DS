# Final Project - Data Science in Communication

## Overview

This is your final project for the Data Science in Communication course. You will work in groups (maximum 5 people) to apply the Python knowledge you've gained throughout this course to conduct a communication research project. The final deliverable will be a Jupyter notebook containing your code, visualizations, and a written explanation of your research process and findings.

## Project Components

Your project should include the following components:

- Introduction: Briefly describe what your project is about.
- Research Questions: Pose research questions that are related to communication studies.
- Dataset Description: Introduce your chosen dataset. Give a detailed description of what this dataset is about, and use the df.describe() function to provide a basic statistical description of the dataset. You can choose a dataset from surveys, social media, or news articles. Make sure your research questions and the chosen dataset are matching.
- Preprocessing: Carry out the preprocessing of your chosen dataset, and justify why those preprocessing steps are related to your research questions.
- Analysis: Choose 2-3 analyses that you have learned in this class (e.g., sentiment analysis, name entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, collocation analysis, topic modeling, network analysis, etc.). Justify why you choose these analyses.
- Visualization: Use matplotlib and/or seaborn to visualize your results.
- Results/Findings: Provide text descriptions for your results/findings.
- Contribution: Specify each group member's contributions.

## Grading Criteria

The project will be graded based on the following criteria:

- Completion: Your project should contain all the required components.
- Clarity and Reproducibility: Your project should be clear enough for people to understand. This includes clear explanations in the Jupyter notebook, good use of comments in your code, and clear visualizations. 
- Creativity: Creativity will be assessed in terms of the analyses you choose and the visualization techniques you employ.
- Code Quality: Your code should run without errors.

## Potential Data Sources

Here are some potential sources for datasets you might want to consider for this project:

- Twitter Climate Change Sentiment Dataset: This dataset contains about 40,000 tweets from April 27, 2021, that are related to climate change. [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/edqian/twitter-climate-change-sentiment-dataset)
- Reddit Vaccine Myths: This dataset contains comments and posts from the subreddit r/VaccineMyths. It spans a period from its inception in 2012 to July 2021. [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda/reddit-vaccine-myths)
- COVID-19 Twitter Sentiment Analysis: This is a dataset of tweets about COVID-19 collected from March 2020. It contains the Tweet's text, username, description, location, and following details. [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datatattle/covid-19-nlp-text-classification)
- News Headlines Dataset for Sarcasm Detection: This dataset contains headlines from news articles, and each headline is labeled as being sarcastic or not. It was last updated in 2019. [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/rmisra/news-headlines-dataset-for-sarcasm-detection)
- CrisisLexT26: This dataset contains a collection of Twitter datasets related to 26 crises that occurred from 2012 to 2019. It includes natural disasters like hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, and man-made incidents like bombings and shootings. [Link](https://crisislex.org/data-collections.html#CrisisLexT26)

Good luck and have fun with your projects!
