# Final Project (Due: 06/12/2023 Midnight; 35%)

## GitHub Classroom: [Link](https://classroom.github.com/a/eDDs8OEu)

## Overview

This is your final project for the Data Science in Communication course. You will work in groups (maximum 5 people) to apply the Python knowledge you've gained throughout this course to conduct a communication research project. The final deliverable will be a Jupyter notebook containing your code, visualizations, and a written explanation of your research process and findings.

## Project Components

Your project should include the following components:

- Introduction: Briefly describe what your project is about.
- Research Questions: Pose research questions that are related to communication studies.
- Dataset Description: Introduce your chosen dataset. Give a detailed description of what this dataset is about, and use the df.describe() function to provide a basic statistical description of the dataset. You can choose a dataset from surveys, social media, or news articles. Make sure your research questions and the chosen dataset are matching.
- Preprocessing: Carry out the preprocessing of your chosen dataset, and justify why those preprocessing steps are related to your research questions.
- Analysis: Choose 2-3 analyses that you have learned in this class (e.g., sentiment analysis, name entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, collocation analysis, topic modeling, network analysis, etc.). Justify why you choose these analyses. If there is only one method that suits your research goal the best, you can use one method only but make sure you use it at least twice (i.e., you have two different but related research questions that both involve this method).
- Visualization: Use matplotlib and/or seaborn to visualize your results.
- Results/Findings: Provide text descriptions for your results/findings.
- Contribution: Specify each group member's contributions.

## Grading Criteria

The project will be graded based on the following criteria:

- Completion (5/35): Your project should contain all the required components.
- Clarity and Reproducibility (10/35): Your project should be clear enough for people to understand. This includes clear explanations in the Jupyter notebook, good use of comments in your code, and clear visualizations. 
- Creativity and Suitability (10/35): Creativity will be assessed in terms of the analyses you choose and the visualization techniques you employ. Suitability refers to whether the chosen analyses and visualization match your research questions.
- Code Quality (10/35): Your code should run without errors.

## Potential Data Sources

Here are some potential sources for datasets you might want to consider for this project:

- Twitter Climate Change Sentiment Dataset: This dataset contains about 40,000 tweets from April 27, 2021, that are related to climate change. [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/edqian/twitter-climate-change-sentiment-dataset)
- Reddit Vaccine Myths: This dataset contains comments and posts from the subreddit r/VaccineMyths. It spans a period from its inception in 2012 to July 2021. [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda/reddit-vaccine-myths)
- COVID-19 Twitter Sentiment Analysis: This is a dataset of tweets about COVID-19 collected from March 2020. It contains the Tweet's text, username, description, location, and following details. [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datatattle/covid-19-nlp-text-classification)
- News Headlines Dataset for Sarcasm Detection: This dataset contains headlines from news articles, and each headline is labeled as being sarcastic or not. It was last updated in 2019. [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/rmisra/news-headlines-dataset-for-sarcasm-detection)
- CrisisLexT26: This dataset contains a collection of Twitter datasets related to 26 crises that occurred from 2012 to 2019. It includes natural disasters like hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, and man-made incidents like bombings and shootings. [Link](https://crisislex.org/data-collections.html#CrisisLexT26)
